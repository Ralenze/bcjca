            <h2>Who are we?</h2>
            <p>
                We are an organization of students with an initiative of bringing together 
                high school chess players through tournaments and matches. 
                We are currently working towards hosting an inter-school league 
                consisting of teams across British Columbia, 
                with in-person qualifiers leading to a final provincial tournament. 
                Our goal is to promote a more connected chess community and 
                strengthen the secondary school chess scene by connecting chess clubs. 
                Currently, we have 25+ clubs representing from all across the 
                Lower Mainland and 150+ members in our community, whom we connect with 
                through our website, our community server, and social media.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the future, we hope to support the creation of chess clubs at schools, 
                continue to host regular in-person tournaments, 
                and teach elementary students the foundations of chess.
